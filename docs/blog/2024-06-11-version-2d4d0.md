We are proud to release a new version of `chemfusekit`: `chemfusekitv2.4.0`.

This update massively increases the usability of the library, and it springs from the new case studies we are running. We hope you will enjoy it.

## Changes and improvements

Classifiers can be instantiated from file, and their underlying models can be imported and exported.

`PCA` can be used to reduce the dimensionality of arbitrary data.

The graphing for the `LLDF` module has been drastically improved, and a long-lived bug messing with table alignment has been solved.

`BaseDataModel` and its derived classes allow for picking a single sample via subscription.

The `LR` module has been revamped to allow for extra support for binary classifiers, solving  long-lived bugs in both training and split testing.
